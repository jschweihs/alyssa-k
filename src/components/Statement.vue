			<br/>
			<p class="paragraph">I believe in creating a classroom environment that fosters acceptance, independence, kindness, creativity, and a love for learning. I aspire to provide an educational environment that inspires students and allows them to feel like intelligent, capable learners that can go on to live successful, independent lives. I desire to institute a classroom climate in which all my students feel comfortable inquiring, engaging, questioning, practicing, and expressing themselves.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">I facilitate the use of evidence-based practices to promote learning and communication amongst my students. I feel it is important for the individuals in my classroom to display kind and caring behaviors towards themselves and others. I encourage students to always to their best and be creative and flexible in problem solving and learning. I employ various educational techniques tailored to multiple learning styles. I differentiate instruction to best serve the needs of the individuals in my classroom as well as modify and adapt lessons and activities to best serve the needs and capabilities of each of my students.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">I know that each of my students can go on to live independent, fulfilling lives. I am committed to supporting my students in achieving this objective. My ultimate goal is for my students to leave my classroom feeling competent, confident, and capable. I am dedicated to using any and all beneficial resources, tools, plans, and strategies to attain this outcome.</p>
