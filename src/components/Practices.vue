			<h1 class="purple-light">Evidence Based Practices</h1>
			<br/>
			<h3 class="orange">There are several EBP’s (evidence-based practices) used within the classroom. The facilitation of each practice is based upon the needs of each individual student. If you’re curious to learn more about evidence-based practices, the research behind them, and their applications, visit the resource tab of our classroom website for links containing more information.</h3>
			<br/>
			<p><b>Visual Supports</b> - We implement the use of various visual supports through the classroom and school day. From picture schedules to visual instructions. Any chance that we have to incorporate visual models or depictions that aid in student learning we are sure to include them.</p>
			<p><b>Modeling</b> - Modeling is a tool we often use in the classroom to provide an example for students of how certain behaviors/activities should look. Staff model behaviors and practices so students can see the proper way to act or preform certain tasks.</p>
			<p><b>Prompting</b> - Prompting provides support and guidance for students. Prompting is a way of indicating to students that a particular action or behavior should occur. This strategy has been shown to increase student success and promote positive actions.</p>
			<p><b>Socials Skills Training</b> - Mainly centered around group activities, SST targets the social skills and behaviors of individual students that need improvement or may require extra practice. These groups and skill development trainings are facilitated by staff and help to improve social skills and communication amongst our students.</p>
			<p><b>Reinforcement</b> - Reinforcement describes the relationship a student places on a behavior and the consequence that results from that behavior. A reinforcing relationship occurs when the consequence that follows the learned action increases the likelihood that the student will repeat the behavior. </p>
			<p><b>Functional Behavior Assessments</b> - FBA’s are used by faculty and staff to collect data and analyze student behaviors so that we may later create beneficial interventions aiding student learning and behavior.</p>
			<p><b>Response Interruption & redirection</b> - This is used to eliminate or halt certain behaviors/actions as they occur and encourage proper conduct instead. This strategy can help to eliminate or greatly reduce negative behaviors and inappropriate actions.</p>
			<p><b>Cognitive Behavioral Interventions</b> - This practice entails students identifying and examining their own thoughts and emotions. Recognizing negative emotions and using coping strategies to modify or change their negative thoughts and feelings.</p>
			<p><b>Naturalistic Interventions</b> - These types of interventions occur in natural settings and environments. With principles based in behaviorism and ABA, using naturalistic interventions students can improve targeted behaviors.</p>
			<p><b>Functional Communication Training</b> - Functional Communication Training allows students to learn and practice effective forms and means of communication to better serve their needs and desires as well as promote social relationships.</p>
			<p><b>Self-management</b> - Students use self-management skills within the classroom to regulate themselves. This practice requires students to recognize the appropriateness or inappropriateness of certain behaviors and use their regulatory skills to monitor or alter their own behaviors based upon this knowledge.</p>
			<p><b>Social Narratives</b> - Sometimes referred to as social stories, these provide students with knowledge and information regarding social cues, body language, and the explanations of certain feelings and behaviors exhibited by others. When students understand the motivations and social expectations of others, students can better function in social environments and situations.</p>
