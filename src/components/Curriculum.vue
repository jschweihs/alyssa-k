			<h1 class="purple-light">Curriculum Guide</h1>
			<br/>
			<h3 class="orange">Our entire curriculum is based upon skills and abilities necessary for life after schooling. All of our concepts and units have real world applications and contain relevant, valuable information. Ensuring our students are working towards a successful and independent future.</h3>
			<br/>
			<h5 class="purple text-center">Reading</h5>
			<p>Monthly Novel Study, Literacy Concept Groups, & Literacy Circles</p>
			<p>Each month we read a novel chosen based upon student interests, using curriculum standards as a guide. We create activities centered around concepts presented in our monthly novel study, as well as analyze the text for deeper meaning and make personal/real world connections. Students demonstrate comprehension of the novel’s plot, concepts, and central themes through various activities tailored to their individual learning needs. We integrate reading into other parts of the curriculum and practice applied reading skills as well. Some examples include: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Reading recipes</li>

We believe writing is an important part of life and our students receive plenty of practice. All writing activities and assignments are adapted and tailored to the needs of each individual student.

			<p>Measurement - From measurements used for cooking and baking, to finding the area and perimeter of objects/spaces. All the measurement practice we do has practical purposes.</p>

			<p>Scheduling – Students exercise time management and scheduling skills through various activities and planned trips throughout the school year</p>
