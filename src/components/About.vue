			<p>My name is Alyssa Kordopitoulas and I am currently in school at Benedictine University in the Special Education Program.  I plan to do well in school and start my career in schools where I can help the students that need it most. My dream goal is to one day have a school of my own that can properly assist students with disabilities and give them an environment in which they can thrive.  My boyfriend is SUPER supportive and helps me every day to achieve my dream.</p>

				<li class="list-text-item purple-light">My favorite types of movies are anything Disney related.  Nothing scary!</li>
