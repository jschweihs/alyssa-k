			<p>My name is Alyssa Kordopitoulas. I attended College of DuPage where I earned my associate degree in arts. I then went on to earn my bachelor's degree in Special Education from Benedictine University. I absolutely love my job and I couldnâ€™t imagine myself doing anything else. I spend most of my time teaching and planning but for fun I enjoy spending time with my loved ones, attending concerts and plays, going to the movies, and reading! I also love to travel and enjoy crafting.</p>
